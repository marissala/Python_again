      "During a time when the press is busy ranking crisis time heroes and putting uncrowned kings on pedestals, we should think about how to keep the whole of society in good spirits to have energy and resources left for the aftermath of the crisis, Erle Loonurm writes.\n",
      "In just a few weeks, time has morphed into corona time under our very eyes. Our reckoning of time has become \"before corona\" and \"after corona.\" At times, it feels like the typewriter of history is being frantically operated by a mad science-fiction writer for whom we are all guinea pigs. Unfortunately, the situation is neither science-fiction nor insanity but a new kind of real life where fear, not even the virus, is public enemy number one.\n",
      "Pictures of an evening trip to the grocery store. People wearing masks, carrying baskets, buying food. Because the mask covers most of a person's face, the eyes stand out. There are calm and inquisitive eyes, while some looks are even indifferent. And then there are eyes that speak of fear. Trepidation.\n",
      "It is probable that the person behind the mask is not sure whether they should be afraid of the virus, the fact that it's spreading, others who might be infected or how to cope should they catch it themselves. Or perhaps it is all of the above.\n",
      "Information has become an unending flood. What to believe and what to read is one question, while the daily reality of the number of confirmed cases and deaths is another entirely. What this mortifying situation does is bring people face-to-face with themselves. And that fear is far beyond what any virus could conjure.\n",
      "Fear\n",
      "It is this fear that becomes a driving force for people in unexpected situations. To overcome the crisis, we need to start with fear. It is a battle where running some people down or lifting individual groups up is of no use whatsoever.\n",
      "During a time when the press is busy concentrating on mistakes made by the Health Board and a minister's unfortunate utterances or crowning those on the front lines of combatting the crisis kings, most of society is left looking on, while no less deserving of the title of hero.\n",
      "Looking on and working every day to ensure the best possible functioning of their company or agency by having to suddenly work remotely, being responsible for employees.\n",
      "Looking on are those who are isolated at home with their children, ensuring their own health and that of their offspring. Looking on are people who have donated or bought computers so children of less fortunate families could take part in remote study.\n",
      "Those who have made the difficult decision to cut their employees' salary, while having to keep them motivated. Those who have to live in the virtual certainty that they will not see a pay rise for months or years but still keep working. And those who cannot help out as volunteers after hours because their families and homes need them.\n",
      "Looking on are people who are afraid. Who sit at home and only leave the house if it cannot be avoided, not being able to tell whether a cough or an unpleasant feeling in their throat is COVID-19 or not because not everyone is tested. Those who go to the grocery store wearing masks and whose eyes betray fear because they have to keep at least two meters between themselves and people they might have had a conversation with while waiting in line only yesterday.\n",
      "All of them are silently looking on as the press puts uncrowned kings on pedestals, hands out gold medals just in case despite the Olympics having been postponed and works on various other rankings.\n",
      "Why create new subconscious rifts in society during difficult times? People need to be commended, of course, but it should not be done at someone else's expense in a crisis.\n",
      "Every member of society is either consciously or subconsciously contributing to overcoming this crisis. By moving on with their daily lives and continuing to work as smoothly as possible in this flood of coronavirus news and under altered circumstances. By sticking together and refraining from manufacturing new fear. Because the latter is the greatest enemy today.\n",
      "An unexpected situation forces a person to look themselves in the eye. Society is not a long jump pit where 5 centimeters makes you better than someone else. Nor is it a marathon course where the person who crosses the finish line first only to collapse on the other side of it wins. The gray area here goes far beyond what a black and white cast of mind can possibly grasp.\n",
      "Anger\n",
      "In addition to fear, anger is another driving force in extreme situations. Finding oneself suddenly isolated at home forces another frank look in the mirror. That is why many now think back to the routine of going to and from work as they would their blessed childhood.\n",
      "Standing orders mean that people have to get used to a new daily schedule and spending all of their time with family members. The daily routine includes new tasks, sums spent at the grocery store have changed, while the possibility of domestic violence spiking has been discussed both in the Estonian and international media. This new situation takes some getting used to both psychologically and financially.\n",
      "Lack of recognition is a chronic condition of our society, as is physical and emotional violence. The solution begins with the self. Self-acceptance and taking care of oneself. While it does sound banal, simple words are often difficult to put into practice. Being the main character in your own life often requires some tenacious knots to be untangled.\n",
      "Acceptance and caring can never be compensated for by anyone from the outside – neither one's colleagues, boss, partner or the government can put a patch of recognition on the void we see when we look within ourselves. It can be done by making peace with oneself that will in turn lead to taking responsibility for one's actions and words. And taking emotional responsibility as an adult helps keep fear at bay.\n",
      "We are not so weak and immature as a society as to only need heroes we can celebrate and applaud, heroes we can relate to in order to maintain our identity. Heroes whose posters to stick on our walls so we could imagine what it would be like to be in their shoes. This is where we need to be ourselves. Unique and useful, acting as the heroes of our own lives. Every difficult situation, crisis or disaster can be overcome then.\n",
      "However, I'm afraid this particular crisis will last far longer than we might imagine. Sailing through it, we will see crisis management and post-crisis management. Once the tsunami has passed and we're left with just stormy seas and rock-strewn beaches, the latter will be felt painfully under our bare feet for a long time still.\n",
      "The thing to ponder is how to get society back on track and keep things going in the abeyance that will follow weeks of stress. Will people tired of having to reorganize their work overnight and living in the conditions of nonstop coronavirus news be able to continue at full steam? If so, then how and at what cost?\n",
      "Answering this question will likely require more effort than replacing tired employees with new blood of which there should be plenty available in the wake of layoffs and bankruptcies. Until the next crisis.\n",
      "What will happen if we'll see a new virus decimate the global economy again in just a few weeks next year? The current experiment where governments all over the world are trying to bring under control that which is not meant to be controlled is an interesting spectacle in itself. Unfortunately, it is also one of the more tragic ones of our time. Economically paralyzing and socially ruinous.\n",
      "However, there is something gaining control over which is far easier and depends on every one of us. It is fear. The greater our responsibility – for our health, immune system, way of life and loved ones, the less power fear has and the less painful the crisis will be in the end.\n",
      "The coronavirus will cause the greatest change in society that we have seen in the past decades. As ever, those capable of adjusting to change will survive. The heroes and crowned heads of our time are those who in addition to adjusting to change can also manage and mold it. This requires one to conquer one's fears and take responsibility. And that is something everyone can do.\n",

People living in the halls of residence must remain at their apartments until they have received the results of their COVID-19 test. On-site catering has been organised for people under restriction of movement. Students who have tested positive for COVID-19 must remain in self-isolation at Raatuse 22 residence until recovery.\n",
      "The restriction of movement applies to people living in the halls of residence until they have been tested for COVID-19, and until all the people who have been in close contact with the infected persons have been identified, and the test results have been returned. In order to prevent the spread of the virus, the halls of residence will be divided into three zones. Residents are placed according to whether they have tested positive for COVID-19, or have been in close contact with an infected person, or have not been in close contact with an infected person, and have tested negative for COVID-19.\n",
      "People who have tested positive for COVID-19 must remain in strict isolation until recovery.\n",
      "People who have been in close contact with the infected persons and who have tested negative for COVID-19 will need to stay at their apartments in the halls of residence for two weeks, and monitor their health status. They will have the opportunity to go outside for fresh air.\n",
      "Residents who have not been in contact with infected persons, and who have tested negative for COVID-19 are allowed to move about freely, taking into account the general movement restrictions due to the emergency situation.\n",
      "The Police and Border Guard Board (PPA) will monitor the observance of restrictions of movement at Raatuse 22.\n",
      "The person in charge of the emergency situation, Mr Jüri Ratas issued an order based on the proposal of the leader of the South region for emergency situation Mr Margo Klaos; having consulted the rector of the University of Tartu Mr Toomas Asser, the Mayor of Tartu Mr Urmas Klaas, Chancellor of Justice Mrs Ülle Madise, and Professor Irja Lutsar of Tartu University.\n",
      "Yesterday, a foreign student of University of Tartu residing at the University´s halls of residence, tested positive for COVID-19. Additional testing was carried out on 17 people who had been in close contact with the infected person, and 5 of them tested positive for COVID-19. The infected persons live in the same halls of residence and participated at a birthday party organised at the residence.\n",
      "The order shall enter into force upon signature. The restrictions are valid until the amendment of the order and will be re-evaluated every two weeks.\n",

      "In an appearance on ETV news broadcast \"Aktuaalne kaamera\" on Monday night, Mait Altmets, director of Infection Control at North Estonia Medical Center (PERH), said that it is those with symptoms who should be wearing face masks in order to prevent the possible spread of a virus to others. Those who are well, he added, have nothing to gain from going around in a face mask.\n",
      "AK anchor Astrid Kannel: I understand that people in Estonia have begun buying up masks and all kinds of cleaning products. Is there any point to wearing a face mask?\n",
      "Mait Altmets: There is a point if you are experiencing symptoms. It isn't the most reasonable thing to just walk around wearing a mask. People often don't know how to use the mask — they pull it under their chin and wear it under their nose, at which point it is entirely pointless, and we're wasting this valuable mask that otherwise might be needed somewhere else later.\n",
      "AK: Who should really be wearing a face mask, someone who is sick or someone afraid of being infected?\n",
      "MA: It should be worn by someone experiencing symptoms, regardless of whether it is coronavirus, the flu or whatever other virus. If you are experiencing symptoms — cough, cold — then you should wear a mask to protect those around you if you need to go out somewhere.\n",
      "AK: How much should one really be washing their hands?\n",
      "MA: When coming here, I asked my children what the best means of preventing coronavirus is. They said coughing into your sleeve and washing your hands. You should wash your hands when they have been contaminated by respiratory fluids, for example, such as after coughing into your hands. And it really is better to cough into your sleeve if you don't have tissues handy and can't wash your hands right away.\n",
      "AK: How much can one irritate the skin on their hands with constant hand-washing and cleaning with various products?\n",
      "MA: People in hospitals use them every day, and 20-30 times per day, and we are completely capable of working. If using them more often, then special alcohol-based antiseptics have hand care products built in, and they are friendlier than soap and water, which dry skin out.\n",
      "AK: How should one be regarding and reacting to all of this in general right now?\n",
      "MA: You should live as you do during other viral seasons. If you are experiencing symptoms, stay home, don't spread it and keep a distance socially. If you need to communicate, do so by phone. And consider avoiding visits. And you should only visit loved ones in the hospital if you are well.\n",
      "AK: Have you yourself also changed any of your behaviors in this panic caused by the coronavirus?\n",
      "MA: I have not.\n",

      "The Health Board is in talks with the Health Insurance Fund (Haigekassa) regarding a plan to give parents of children arriving home from areas affected by the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) two weeks' paid sick leave, which would allow them to stay home with their children.\n",
      "Latvia decided on Tuesday to implement a system of two weeks' paid sick leave to parents which would allow children returning from areas affected by the novel coronavirus to remain at home and not attend school or kindergarten for a period of two weeks.\n",
      "Health Board Deputy Director General Jelena Tomasova said on Vikerraadio broadcast \"Uudis+\" on Wednesday that the Health Board wants to implement a similar measure in Estonia as well.\n",
      "\"Talks are currently underway with the Health Insurance Fund regarding the latter likewise paying for parents on sick leave together with their children as a preventive measure, but right now this is a sort of matter of agreement, that we inform and request that people who have arrived stay at home if possible,\" Tomasova said.\n",
      "She added that keeping children home from school or kindergarten is a little easier to accomplish, but with adults it depends on the nature of the work, as certain work can be done from home as well, but that isn't the case for drivers or factory workers, for example.\n",
      "\"We are calling on employers to be understanding, and that they be accommodating and allow for their employee to be at home for a two-week period,\" the deputy director general said.\n",
      "According to Tomasova, the matter of whether the Health Insurance Fund will pay for two weeks of preventive sick leave for parents staying home with their children should hopefully be decided within the next two or three days.\n",
      "Whether or not the coronavirus would spread to Estonia as the current school break concludes is difficult for the Health Board to predict, but according to Tomasova, there is a medium risk of the virus being brought to Estonia, but the risk of it spreading is low.\n",
      "Arrivals to Estonia by plane with symptoms of the illness will be given questionnaires on the flight and taken to the hospital upon arrival, and contaminated persons will be further handled by Health Board employees.\n",
      "It is impossible to guarantee that the covid-19 virus will not spread to Estonia, but according to Tomasova, the Health Board is doing everything it can to ensure that should the virus reach Estonia, the country's healthcare system is prepared and its laboratories equipped to diagnose the virus.\n",

However, it seems to me that the municipalities should also develop their own measures, and this was also the subject of today's meeting. We asked a colleague to analyze the potential impact of each measure and so that when we start restricting or banning something, we are prepared for the consequences,\" the mayor said.\n",

      "The Estonian government has been accused of inciting panic as well as being inactive, in the wake of the recent spread of COVID-19 coronavirus cases in the country. However, the government's behavior to date has been balanced, and there is no reason for panic, write lawyers Allar Jõks and Piret Schasmin. At the same time, the law does not allow for mandatory quarantining in any case.\n",
      "Reading the various news portals in Estonia, one could be forgiven for thinking that Estonia was in an unusually special situation. The number of dramatic stories has already surpassed those last autumn (when stories regarding comments made by interior minister Mart Helme dominated the headlines for a time-ed.)\n",
      "The figure of coronavirus victims in the country continues to grow, standing at 10 at the time of writing; the Italian government closed all its schools and universities two days ago, with several regions in the north of the country establishing quarantine conditions.\n",
      "Some days ago, before Estonia experienced its first confirmed case, Martin Kadai, head of the emergency department at the Health Board (Terviseamet) said that unlike Italy, Estonia would not be doing the same.\n",
      "However, what quarantine means in legal terms and in what cases it can be imposed in Estonia has so far been overlooked.\n",
      "Pursuant to the Communicable Diseases Prevention and Control Act (hereinafter NETS), quarantine is a restriction on the movement of people, goods, vehicles and services, the purpose of which is to prevent the spread of a particularly dangerous communicable disease beyond its current the outbreak. A distinction must be made between this and \"voluntary quarantine\", when people impose restrictions on movement themselves.\n",
      "NETS only allows local government to impose quarantine following a proposal from the Health Board in the case of a particularly serious infectious disease. Particularly dangerous infectious diseases in the understanding of NETS include cholera, yellow fever and tuberculosis, meaning coronavirus does not constitute a particularly dangerous infectious disease.\n",
      "Does this mean that the country will experience a short battle with the virus, after which the Riigikogu should change the law and redefine coronavirus as a particularly dangerous infectious disease?\n",
      "No it does not, because under NETS, a local authority may, again on a proposal from the Health Board, temporarily close schools, childcare and welfare facilities, requiring them to be disinfected, fumigated in the case of insectoid pests, or otherwise cleaned, and instigate public health surveys.\n",
      "The head of a childcare or welfare institution may also, on his or her own initiative, temporarily close an institution they manage, in coordination with the Health Service regional office.\n",
      "If coronara virus begins to endanger the lives and health of large numbers of people, the government may also declare a state of emergency and, if necessary, impose a ban on certain areas, or restrict freedom of movement.\n",
      "However, such intense restrictions on fundamental rights could apply only in exceptional circumstances, if the spread of the virus in Estonia was already so widespread.\n",
      "We have to agree with Ants Nõmper, who wrote in Postimees on March 5 that the current situation in Estonia does not justify declaring a state of emergency.\n",
      "The Estonian government has been accused of inciting panic and inaction. In light of the above, the behavior of the government to date can be considered balanced, and there is no reason for panic. At the moment, it really seems that \"the corona virus is infecting Estonia the most via social media,\" as [ERR journalist] Marju Himma wrote.\n",

      "\"In the second stage, the question is for how long are we prepared to live through it. Strategically, I support agreeing on solving this health crisis in a month. This would mean stronger short-term measures. This would not see - it is my opinion, but must certainly be coordinated with specialists, experts - everyone at home at all times. Certainly it would mean imposing more restrictions on workplaces. Then it will be possible to normalize it,\" Ossinovski said.\n",
      "\"Right now we declared an emergency situation with some restrictions, then two weeks later the situation worsened and more restrictions were imposed. It is likely there will be more. But when will all of this end - nobody can answer as there is no such plan,\" he added.\n",
      "The lifting of restrictions implemented for the duration of the emergency situation will be based not on economic but rather health-based logic, and as there is currently no certainty regarding how the coronavirus will continue to spread, no strategy exists for exiting the standstill either, said Ministry of Economic Affairs and Infrastructure Deputy Secretary General for Economic Development Viljar Lubi on Monday.\n",

      "\"We can't expect a vaccine anytime soon,\" she said. \"I predict by the end of the year, at the earliest. There is no vaccine coming, and we have to try to survive with the virus in such a way that it doesn't destroy us much. I believe that that is most important right now.\"\n",

      "The government at its Monday meeting approved the installation of thermal imaging cameras at Tallinn Airport and the Old Harbor at the Port of Tallinn as well as the proposal to install disinfectants in public institutions. Where exactly the sources of funding will come from to pay for these measures will be discussed by the government on Thursday.\n",
      "A working group led by Minister of Social Affairs Tanel Kiik (Center) proposed combating the spread of the novel coronavirus by monitoring the health status of travelers at Tallinn Airport and Old Harbor with the help of thermal imaging cameras. Arrivals in Estonia at these two ports of entry will be monitored by the Police and Border Guard Board (PPA) in order to identify arrivals from at-risk regions whose health should be monitored. The government approved this proposal.\n",
      "The government likewise approved the proposal to install disinfectants at airports, ports, bus stations, schools and educational institutions and other public institutions and businesses.\n",
      "In accordance with a proposal by the working group, the government is recommending anyone returning from at-risk areas abroad to remain at home for a period of two weeks if possible and necessary, and work together with their employers to figure out options for working from home if possible. If no such opportunity exists and the individual falls ill, they should contact their family doctor, who will assess the situation and, if necessary, issue a sick leave certificate.\n",
      "The government supported the Health Board's recommendation for children returning from at-risk areas to stay home from school or kindergarten for two weeks if possible, completing their studies via distance learning. Each educational institution has the right to make their own decisions at their discretion regarding necessary changes to teaching arrangements.\n",
      "The government likewise supported the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' and Health Board's recommendations not to travel to at-risk areas. The state recommends all Estonian residents review their travel plans and make judicious decisions regarding them.\n",
      "Calculations by the Health Board and the Ministry of Social Affairs indicate that expenses in the field will total some €3 million, exclusive of labor costs. Where exactly the sources of funding will come from to pay for these measures will be discussed by the government at its next Cabinet meeting this Thursday.\n",
      "Kiik's working group drew up several proposals aimed at combating the spread of the virus, including checks of those who have returned from at-risk aras, the expansion of Health Board staff, and the issuing of additional guidelines for residents, institutions as well as businesses; the government will discuss these measures on Thursday.\n",
      "The minister was glad that his working group's proposals received the approval of the government.\n",
      "\"These were very broad-based preparations in which most ministries, the Health Board, the State Agency of Medicines, the Health Insurance Fund, the PPA and the Rescue Board all took part,\" Kiik said. \"In working out these proposals, we also met with representatives of the Port of Tallinn and Tallinn Airport, Tallinn hospitals, paramedics, and family doctors, and we also discussed necessary measures with representatives of pharmacists as well as pharmaceuticals producers and drug wholesalers.\"\n",
      "He noted that coronavirus has been tested for over 70 times in Estonia, adding that the situation remains stable and no new cases have been confirmed since Estonia's first case last week. Nonetheless, he added, the state must be prepared for the worst.\n",

      "The Health Board has decided to close coronavirus (COVID-19) disease wards in smaller hospitals from Monday as the situation across the country starts to stabilize, it was announced on Saturday.\n",
      "Arkadi Popov, chief medical official for the emergency situation at the Health Board, said at a press conference on Saturday: \"We assume that the situation is stabilizing and we can hope that COVID-positive patients will no longer have to be treated in small hospitals - we are talking about general hospitals and local hospitals.\"\n",
      "He emphasized that hospital Emergency Medicine Departments (EMOs) must still be prepared to receive such patients.\n",
      "Popov explained the decision had been made because the number of COVID patients has started to decrease.\n",
      "\"The number is declining, so there is no longer a great need to have COVID departments in small hospitals and also in certain large hospitals, such as the East Tallinn Central Hospital (ITK). We agreed at the level of the Northern Medical Board that there will be no COVID department in the classical format, but that EMO capacity must be ensured, including the treatment of COVID-positive patients,\" he explained.\n",
      "In addition, the ITK must ensure the capacity of obstetrics and gynecology, as well as intensive care.\n",
      "\"This is just in case, rather so that if - in a hypothetical situation - we need to expand the intensive care capacity in addition to the North Estonian Medical Center (PERH), then ITK can also ensure it,\" Popov said. \"And we also agreed with the West Tallinn Central Hospital that they will be able to receive more patients who need oxygen therapy, we currently have enough places in its infection clinic, so there is such a possibility,\" he explained.\n",
      "The Health Board is also thinking about restoring the normal situation in Kuressaare Hospital, the medical manager said. \"For this purpose, a roadmap has been prepared for Kuressaare Hospital, which should lead to the resumption of normal work there - COVID departments should become so-called clean areas and staff who can work in these areas must also be selected. In the longer term, we are also talking about the resumption of planned work at Kuressaare Hospital,\" said Popov.\n",
      "In accordance with this plan, the field hospital currently located in Kuressaare will act as a buffer. \"I hope that in the near future - although not next week - the field hospital can be brought back to the mainland,\" Popov added.\n",

      "Insurance that will cover voluntary travel cancellations is expensive and not purchased by most travelers, however in the case of standard travel insurance, insurers will not compensate losses incurred in connection with an epidemic or the quarantine of specific areas.\n",
      "In addition to China, the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has also reached several European countries, and the more cases are reported, the more situations arise in which people cancel planned trips or have to take into consideration when traveling to affected areas that they may end up there for longer than planned in case they fall ill or are quarantined.\n",
      "Estonian Insurance Association (EKsL) board member Andres Piirsalu told ERR that travelers typically sign up for travel insurance that will cover medical expenses in the event of unexpected illness.\n",
      "If someone has also taken out a travel cancellation insurance policy, then the extent to which it will cover losses will depend upon the extent of the policy they took out.\n",
      "\"If someone decides to cancel their trip out of fear of the virus, insurance will cover the costs of the canceled trip if the policyholder has chosen the appropriate insurance coverage,\" Piirsalu explained. \"As coverage for voluntary cancellations typically makes travel insurance more expensive in general, then as far as we know, people don't typically purchase such policies.\"\n",
      "Insurance companies are advising those who have travel planned in the near future to review their travel insurance policies as well as consult with their insurers.\n",
      "According to Piirsalu, if someone is already on a trip to an area that ends up quarantined, preventing them from returning home on schedule, losses incurred as a result will typically not be covered under a regular travel insurance policy.\n",
      "\"Under travel insurance practices, losses incurred in connection with an epidemic or the actions of public authorities are not covered,\" he noted.\n",
      "Travel at one's own risk not covered\n",
      "If Insurance personal insurance product manager Kairit Luht said that If will not pay compensation in cases where losses were caused by a nationally declared epidemic, with the exception of travel cancellation compensation used to cover additional expenses incurred in returning to Estonia.\n",
      "\"The aforementioned exclusion likewise won't apply to medical care insurance if an insured event occurred within 14 days of the outbreak of an epidemic and the insured was already traveling prior to the outbreak,\" she said.\n",
      "Much depends on when exactly a quarantine is imposed or when the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has issued a travel advisory, as according to Luht, additional expenses incurred on accommodations and returning to Estonia will only be covered in the event that an outbreak has begun or a quarantine imposed after one's trip already began. These expenses will not be covered, however, in the event that someone has traveled to an area regarding which the ministry has already issued a travel advisory, as in that case, the insured has traveled there at their own risk.\n",
      "Seesam Insurance travel insurance product manager Jonatan Jõks said that when purchasing a travel insurance policy from them, it is possible to purchase additional extended coverage or coverage for voluntary travel cancellation as well.\n",
      "\"Expenses incurred as a result of the cancellation of a conference are eligible for reimbursement if the insured has signed up for extended coverage,\" Jõks explained. \"This covers not only events cancelled as a result of the virus but also other cancelled events and risks such as natural disasters, strikes, terrorism, etc. Potential costs incurred as a result of ending up in quarantine are likewise only eligible for reimbursement under extended travel cancellation coverage.\"\n",
      "If a traveler has only signed up for basic travel insurance, Seesam doesn't consider either of these situations to be an insured event. Purchasing a policy including voluntary travel cancellation coverage, however, will allow for a traveler to receive partial compensation for a trip canceled out of fear of the virus.\n",
      "According to Jõks, such a policy can be used for other reasons as well, and it will cover 70 percent of the policyholder's expenses otherwise not recoverable from hotels, airlines or other service providers. \"But this coverage can only be purchased within two weeks of purchasing one's trip, no later,\" he added.\n",

If needed, the patient will be taken to hospital by an ambulance; in Tallinn, patients requiring hospital treatment are admitted to the West Tallinn Central Hospital.

Calculations by the Health Board and the Ministry of Social Affairs indicate that expenses in the field will total some €3 million, exclusive of labor costs.\n",
      "Speaking on Vikerraadio morning broadcast \"Vikerhommik\" on Monday, Kiik said that in terms of spread of the virus, the situation in Estonia is currently stable. The one case of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) confirmed last week has thus far remained the only confirmed case.\n",
      "As of Monday, some 60 additional people have been tested for the virus who had either themselves recently been in at-risk regions or whose loved ones had and who had exhibited symptoms of the disease, however all of these tests have turned up negative.\n",
      "Based on Ministry of Foreign Affairs and travel agency data, the Ministry of Social Affairs has also attempted to map out how many Estonian residents are currently or have recently been located in at-risk regions, and according to Kiik, this figure may reach into the thousands.\n",
      "The social affairs minister is requesting people remember when asked by the Health Board to remain home for two weeks after returning from an at-risk region that their health and that of those around them are the most important thing. He noted that one doesn't necessarily have to be sick in order to receive a sick leave certificate from their doctor, but doctors must make an informed decision in each case regarding whether or not to issue one.\n",
      "The Estonian government is convening on Monday to discuss proposals worked out by the working group formed by Kiik for the prevention of the spread of the novel coronavirus. Kiik's primary request of the government is that it in principle endorses these proposals, and that if it considers any additional measures necessary, that it provides proposals of its own accordingly.\n",
      "\"The matter of sources of funding will certainly come up — i.e. what will the actual additional cost be, as we know that preventing the virus will require additional human resources, thermal imaging cameras cost money, as will all kinds of protective gear, which is frequently purchased as backup and just in case, but you can't start ordering them once the virus has already spread too far, you have to buy them now already,\" the minister described.\n",

      "The Estonian aviation sector has never done so well as before the coronavirus outbreak. Back in February, one could still choose between 28 direct destinations flying out of Tallinn. Today, there are only three destinations left. The tourism sector has been hit first and hard. Next to suffer will be international trade. Estonia depends on foreign direct investments to a great degree and investors prefer direct connections. A state aid package is essential for survival. However, helping one or two companies is not enough. Support will be needed across the whole sector in order to -preserve the value chain, head of the Estonian Aviation Cluster Kristo Reinsalu writes.\n",
      "The collapse of Virgin Australia after the briefest of struggles indicates the world's weakest airlines have little time to secure funds before they succumb to the coronavirus. \"In most countries, federal governments have stepped up, in what is an unprecedented crisis for aviation, to help their airlines. Sadly, that has not happened in Australia,\" wrote billionaire founder Richard Branson after he made a last-ditch appeal for government support for the country's second largest airline.\n",
      "The International Air Transport Association that represents nearly 300 airlines has said that half face bankruptcy in two to three months without government help. Many carriers have furloughed staff and grounded entire fleets. IATA has warned that 25 million jobs in aviation and related sectors are at risk. According to IATA updated analysis, the COVID-19 crisis will see airline passenger revenues drop by $314 billion in 2020, a 55 percent decline compared to 2019.\n",
      "Many European airlines spent much of the past two decades asking governments to leave the airline industry. Now, many are begging for help. The Latvian state has pledged €150 million for AirBaltic to ensure air connectivity between Europe and Riga. Italy is close to taking full control of Alitalia, Norway and Portugal plan to do the same for Norwegian Air and TAP Portugal respectively. AirFrance/KLM is requesting aid from the Dutch and French governments. Even Europe´s largest airline, Lufthansa, was assured by the German government that it would not be left to its own devices. \"Financial relief for airlines today should be a critical policy measure for governments. Every airline job saved will keep 24 more people employed,\" said Alexandre de Juniac, IATA's director general and CEO.\n",
      "Estonian aviation was a rapidly growing sector of the economy\n",
      "The Estonian aviation sector was seeing record-breaking growth in recent years. In 2019 alone, the number of passengers at Tallinn airport reached 3.27 million. In 2020, a growth of 5 percent was expected. The average value of one added employee in the aviation sector was estimated at €60 000, which is twice as high as the Estonian average. If we assume that every €1 in GDP contributes about 35 cents of tax revenue to the state budget, in 2019 alone, the Estonian aviation sector provided the state budget with more than €300 million in tax revenue.\n",
      "The situation has changed dramatically today. Air traffic in Estonia has decreased by some 82 percent compared to the same period a year earlier. Overall, global air traffic is expected to decline by 48 percent this year. In April 2019, air traffic controllers from the Estonian Air Navigation Services (EANS) operated on average 668 flights every day, today the number is a mere 120.\n",
      "Members of the Estonian Aviation Cluster provide around 2,000 high-paying jobs. Based on IATA's 1:24 ratio, the aviation sector has contributed to the creation of 40 000 jobs in the Estonian economy. According to some estimates, 150 different companies are providing services to Tallinn Airport alone. We should also be aware that there are jobs in many sectors of the national economy that will be lost without a functioning aviation industry, including tourism, trade, export-oriented manufacturing and services etc.\n",
      "If the negative scenario is allowed to manifest and the state refuses to aid the Estonian aviation sector, a total of 500 jobs will be lost in 2020 alone. If this happens, Estonia will face the Lithuanian scenario – national carrier Fly LAL became insolvent and filed for bankruptcy in early 2009. Losing its national airline, Lithuania suffered serious damage to links between the capital city Vilnius and the rest of the world.\n",
      "Aviation is a special sector\n",
      "We have every right to support the aviation sector by all possible means, including through European Commission (EC) and national state aid today. The rules are different in aviation and it would not be illegal to provide larger amounts of state aid in the current situation for aviation companies. Thus, creation of a state aid package is critical for the development of the aviation sector and ensuring the country´s competitiveness:\n",
      "- Aid in the form of direct grants or equity. State-owned airline Nordica has asked an injection from the state to be prepared to operate flights out of Tallinn once the coronavirus crisis that has completely cut Estonia off from Europe ends.\n",
      "- Aid to restart air traffic at Tallinn airport. We have proposed offering airlines a discount of 75 percent on aviation and 30 percent on handling and infrastructure fees between June 2020 and March 2021.\n",
      "- Short-term export credit insurance to free the capital of distressed companies with a state guarantee. Even the world's largest airlines have extended the deadlines for paying bills.\n",
      "- Aid in the form of wage subsidies for employees to avoid layoffs during the COVID-19 outbreak. Laying off and then rehiring high-paid specialists involved in the Estonian aviation sector could prove to be time-consuming and very costly.\n",
      "- Aid in the form of deferrals of tax and/or of social security contributions to reduce the liquidity constraints of aviation companies and preserve employment.\n",
      "Conclusion\n",
      "Before the outbreak of the Corona-19 virus, the Estonian aviation sector was one of the fastest growing economic sectors in Estonia: high-paid jobs, considerable tax revenues for the State Treasury, twice the Estonian average value added per employee, export-intensive services. Today, however, we are in a new situation where the sector's future stakes no longer depend on our own actions. We strongly believe that it is not enough to support one or two companies because a lot of companies are intertwined and interdependent in the aviation value chain. Therefore, it is necessary to draw a more detailed and comprehensive plan for state aid measures as other countries are doing.\n",
      "DID YOU KNOW?\n",
      "The average income of a graduate student at the Estonian Aviation Academy is the highest among all Estonian higher education institutions' graduates.\n",
      "The largest-ever national airline Nordica is ready to re-establish airline connections shortly after the current coronavirus restrictions will be relaxed.\n",
      "Magnetic MRO has been Estonia's company of the year on several occasions and is a strong export-oriented service provider servicing almost 100 aircraft a year in its hangars.\n",
      "The Estonian Aviation Cluster, established in 2019, unites 15 ambitious member-companies across the aviation value chain from airport to multiple airlines, maintenance, IT, logistics and transport.\n",

      "The Tartu University Hospital is increasing its level of preparedness for receiving coronavirus (COVID-19) patients in need of emergency hospitalization and has temporarily expanded its emergency department.\n",
      "Chairman of the hospital's management board Priit Eelmäe said the change was necessary to meet the increased need for medical care should the number of patients requiring emergency hospitalization go up.\n",
      "\"From March 20, the Tartu University Hospital has the capability to treat patients in need of emergency medical care in two separate wards. The current emergency ward is planned to house COVID-19 patients only, and a supplementary emergency room for non-COVID-19 patients will be set up on the ground floor of the haematology and oncology clinic,\" Eelmäe said.\n",
      "Changes in the organization of work were developed by the hospital's crisis committee for minimizing the possible spread of COVID-19 among inpatients and increase preparedness should the number of patients suddenly surge.\n",
      "Head of the crisis management team Joel Starkopf said Tartu University Hospital has already introduced movement restrictions and social distancing measures by postponing outpatient treatment and planned activities.\n",
      "\"In order to restrict workers' and patients' movement between wards, the crisis management team has issued guidelines for reorganizing work by department. A fourth intensive care ward has been created along with two wards for infectious diseases for COVID-19 patients. For patient protection purposes, the capacity of the emergency room has likewise been increased,\" Starkopf said.\n",
      "The second emergency room for non-COVID-19 patients can be accessed through a mobile triage unit set up for a preliminary assessment of the patient's medical needs. If a patient has recently developed either a cough, sore throat of breathing difficulties and a fever of at least 37.8 degrees Celsius, they will be sent to the first ward for COVID-19 patients.\n",
      "Patients requiring hospital treatment may increase next week.\n",
      "Speaking on ETV's \"Ringvaade\" Starkopf said there may be an increase next week in the number of patients with COVID-19 needing to be treated in hospital.\n",
      "He said there are currently four people who have tested positive for coronavirus in Tartu University Hospital, but the hospital is preparing to receive more patients.\n",
      "\"Prediction is a thankless task, but forecasting models say that the need for hospitalization will increase from the beginning of next week, at the end of next week and beyond,\" he said.\n",
      "Starkopf said it is too early to say when the number of new patients will start to decline. \"We are waiting two weeks from the emergency situation and then we may be able to assess the situation in the country more accurately. At the moment, we are on standby and fully prepared,\" he said.\n",
      "The hospital's biggest concern right now is personal protective equipment because it is very expensive but difficult to access. He confirmed the hospital has a stock of personal protective equipment for the next three to four weeks.\n",
      "Microbiologist: A mask should be worn only by the sick\n",
      "Paul Naaber, head of infectious diseases at Synlab, said on \"Ringvaade\" as COVID-19 is spread by droplets, it should not spread more than two meters or stay airborne for long.\n",
      "He said the mask should be worn by the sick so they don't spread the virus themselves. Adding the mask should not be worn for more than three hours in a row and should be discarded rather than put in a pocket and used again.\n",
      "\"If a patient puts on a homemade mask to prevent the drops from going forward, it will probably protect others,\" he said.\n",

      "In mobile sample tents established ten days ago, a little over a hundred corona samples have been taken from Narva citizens, although the capability is many times higher, ETV current affairs show \"Aktuaalne kaamera\" reported.\n",
      "On two days, the tent was even closed, due to the lack of people wanting to be tested. The municipality has blamed family doctors, who they say haven´t directed people to take the test. Family doctors confirm that there few patients with the required symptoms, and there´s no reason to test a healthy patient.\n",
      "The family doctors society board head, Karmen Joller, explained the situation by the fact that when the coronavirus first arrived in Estonia (in late February-ed.), people already started to distance themselves from each other, and washing their hands more. This had also had an effect on the incidence of common flu strains.\n",
      "\"Actually, the good old flu has almost retreated. There are a few other diseases as well, I also see it in my practice. Maybe this is one of the reasons. As far as I can understand, the family doctors know very well which kind of patients should be directed [to testing],\" Joller said.\n",

      "\"Europe is facing two quickly developing crises which mutually reinforce one another,\" Helme said. \"Even bigger masses of immigrants than in 2015 are on the move from Turkey toward Europe, which is why in addition to containing the spread of the coronavirus, Europe must also be prepared for a new migration crisis.\"\n",

      "The Estonian Health Insurance Fund (EHIF) launched a number of analyses and checks this week to assess coronavirus-prompted reorganizations in treatment and the availability of medical care. This includes an audit of Kuressaare Hospital.\n",
      "Member of the management board of the Health Insurance Fund Maivi Parv said with the coronavirus having caused several changes and additional costs to hospitals, family doctors and dentists, the Health Insurance Fund is conducting multiple analyses and checks to determine if the use of funds has been targeted and whether or not treatment guidelines have been followed.\n",
      "One of the analyses launched examines the consequences of suspension in scheduled treatment and whether or not the decision has increased the number of patients requiring hospitalization due to severe illnesses, such as infarction and ischemic stroke, Parv said.\n",
      "The board will also check if certificates for sick leave have been issued on justified grounds.\n",
      "An audit will also be carried out at Kuressaare Hospital on Estonia's large western island of Saaremaa to obtain an overview of treatment of coronavirus patients. The results of the audit will become clear in about a month.\n",
      "The audit will be conducted by the Health Insurance Fund in cooperation with representatives of the North and South medical headquarters and the Estonian Society for Infectious Diseases. In the next review stage, treatment of coronavirus patients in other hospitals will be assessed as well.\n",
      "Supplementary reporting will also be carried out with regard to the funding of first-level family medicine centers, which have been on call during the outbreak. Family medicine centers' expenses also grew in relation to increased use of personal protective equipment and reorganizations required for receiving coronavirus patients.\n",
      "As several dental care clinics were also closed to curb the outbreak, designated clinics only provided emergency dental care, which also necessitated increased use of personal protective gear, the costs of which the Health Insurance Fund plans to compensate on the basis of documentation.\n",
      "The organization and provision of remote consultation will also be reviewed as part of the checks to be carried out into treatment documentation.\n",
      "Several audits lie ahead\n",
      "As the coronavirus has brought many changes and additional costs to hospitals, family doctors and dentists, the EHIF will carry out a number of analyzes and inspections.\n",
      "\"We will start in Kuressaare, because there are a considerable number of medical records there. In parallel, or next, we will do it in the following hospitals, where there have been corona-positive patients,\" said Parv.\n",
      "The final stage of the audit will examine the activities of family doctors with coronavirus patients. Compliance with treatment guidelines and agreed criteria is assessed on a random basis.\n",
      "\"Whatever these results are, we get confirmation that they have either been well treated or there have been shortcomings. The audit's finding does not apply to one particular hospital, it is a lesson for the whole system. We are in a special situation today where all parties had to make decisions very quickly,\" said Parv.\n",
      "The work organization, remuneration system, various guidelines and instructions will be reviewed to see if they worked or why they didn't.\n",
      "\"We're going to audit on an emergency basis, based on compliance agreements. If we have clarifying questions, we may want to expand the audit. We have to realize that the pace of work there has been three times more intense than usual. The results of the audit are all useful for the future, [to show] what we have to do differently, [or] change,\" said Parv.\n",
      "The analysis also looks at the impact of suspending scheduled treatments.\n",
      "\"The EHIF is analyzing whether the suspension of planned treatment increased the hospitalization of patients with certain acute illnesses, such as a heart attack or stroke,\" he explained.\n",

      "Estonian politicians and analysts believe there are other, better measures to help European Union member states in need rather than issuing a common Eurobond, dubbed a \"corona bond\". The European Council will discuss the subject next week.\n",
      "Euronews website explained corona bonds as: \"joint debt issued to member states of the EU. The funds would be common and would come from the European Investment Bank. This would be mutualised debt, taken collectively by all member states of the European Union.\"\n",
      "Nine EU countries have called for such bonds to be issued: Spain, Italy, France, Belgium, Luxembourg, Ireland, Portugal, Greece and Slovenia.\n",
      "A common Eurobond would mean money would be borrowed jointly, but it could be used by financially disadvantaged countries, ETV's \"Aktuaalne kaamera\" reported on Wednesday night.\n",
      "\"This is an old wish that Southern Europe can make its loose fiscal policy in solidarity with others. I think we should not let this happen now,\" said Jürgen Ligi, a member of the Finance Committee and a member of the Reform Party.\n",
      "The government is of the same opinion.\n",
      "Prime Minister Jüri Ratas (Center) said: \"Here, the European Union Affairs Committee of the Riigikogu has sent a clear message that if we talk specifically about corona bonds, we do not think that this is the best measure. But the European Union will never leave its Member States in trouble, and I am absolutely convinced that those countries that have been hit hard - Spain, Italy and also Belgium - if assistance is needed, it must be provided. Then other measures must be found, other ways.\"\n",
      "Ratas said the dissenting opinion of the member states on the issuance of joint bonds is so great that overcoming it at next week's council is not realistic.\n",

      "According to the Estonian Association of Security Companies (Eesti Turvaettevõtete Liit), the supplies of the disinfectants, rubber gloves and protective masks that are necessary for their employees are running out, but purchasing more is not possible, or is unreasonably expensive. In addition, the association wants, similarily to police and medical workers, security personnel to be able to protect themselves from the virus and get tested easily.\n",
      "\"While two weeks ago, it was possible to purchase the protective masks for €4 per box, in the meantime, all the masks have run out, and now a box costs €40. Furthermore, they are promising that the box will cost even more,\" Head of the Association of Security Companies Andre Lilleleht said in a letter he wrote to the Minister of the Interior Mart Helme.\n",
      "According to Lilleleht, security employees also need protective equipment to avoid getting infected with the virus, and they are waiting for help from the state to provide them with protective masks, rubber gloves and disinfectants.\n",
      "\"Security companies have spent tens of thousands of euros on purchasing protective equipment (costing between €10,000 and €13,000 for larger companies). With prices rising, businesses will no longer be able to purchase the essentials themselves. /.../ Currently, the solution would be to separate resources from the state´s reserves for critical items or the possibility of purchasing protective equipment from these stocks at the former, more reasonable prices. \"\n",

      "As a result, there are fewer employees and security agencies and companies will soon be unable to find security staff.\n",
      "\"In this case, there is an immediate increase in security risks in many key areas of society. Therefore, rapid needs-based testing of security staff must happen to give frontline employees certainty as to whether or not they are carrying the virus.\"\n",

      "Overproduction of natural gas drives prices to record low ({{contentCtrl.commentsTotal}})\n",
      "The warmer than average winter, competing fuels, and fierce competition between gas sellers have led to natural gas prices falling to their lowest level in a decade. At the same time, gas consumption is decreasing and private consumers are turning to alternatives.\n",
      "Last autumn, the price of natural gas fell to its lowest level in the last decade and has continued to fall since then. One of the reasons for the long-term decline in gas prices is the oversupply of gas on the world market and the unwillingness of major producers, especially the US and Russia, to reduce gas supplies. The coronavirus has also played a role in the price drop last month - Chinese companies are refusing to accept new supplies of LNG, or liquefied natural gas (LNG), which has pushed global prices for LNG to rock, according to Reuters.\n",
      "Estonia's largest and practically the only gas importer, Eesti Gaas, which imports most of its gas from Russia, does not see a big problem with the low price, but sees good news for the consumer.\n",
      "Raul Kotov, Member of the Board of Eesti Gaas, told ERR that the price of gas is influenced by the price of competing fuels, such as heavy and light fuel oil, as well as by competition between gas sellers. However, this year's warm winter in Europe and the coronavirus in Asia meant that stocks traditionally collected before winter turned out to be too high and there was an oversupply.\n",
      "He said: \"Traditionally, gas prices have been lower in the summer months and higher in the winter due to higher winter consumption and lower summer consumption. This was also the case in 2019. At the beginning of the year the price was higher, in summer it fell and in autumn it started to rise again. However, the unexpectedly warm winter in Europe and the corona virus reduced demand in both the U.S. and Asia. If the price rose in December, then in January it has already fallen and forecasts continue for it to fall in February and March.\"\n",
      "Kotov said prices are expected to rise again in November, but that gas prices should stay lower prices than in 2018-2019 for the next two to three years.\n",
      "Consumption is falling, consumers are looking for alternatives\n",
      "For consumers, lower prices are good news. At the same time, the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Communications said gas consumption has been declining, as shown by last year. The use of natural gas is expected to increase and be used in new areas such as district heating and transport.\n",
      "The gas system operator Elering reported consumption in Estonia decreased by 8.6 per cent last year compared to 2018, totaling 4.8 terawatt hours. \"The reason for the decline is probably still the outdoor temperature and the partial switch from gas to biofuels in district heating,\" said Ain Köster, communications manager at Elering.\n",
      "Raul Kotov pointed out the same reasons, especially the warmer weather and that new household boilers have started to run on wood chips. District heating is an important area for gas, however, since one fifth of the gas consumed in Estonia is used there. One third is used exclusively in industry.\n",
      "However, Kotov does not think private customers are looking for alternative fuels. \"Individual private customers tend not to give up gas, because gas heating is the most convenient fuel - it is automated, there is no storage required, and it's clean - it is the most popular\" he said.\n",
      "Kotov noted alternative solutions are more likely to be considered when there is no connection, or it is too expensive to connect to, gas.\n",
      "The number of gas consumers has not been influenced by the accidents reported in the media which are connected to gas heating and carbon monoxide poisoning, he said.\n",
      "State policy directs people away from using gas\n",
      "As gas is not part of renewable energy, its consumption is also affected by the national energy policy.\n",
      "For example, heat pumps may be preferred in new residential areas because they have \"certain advantages due to the new minimum requirements for energy efficiency,\" Kotov said.\n",
      "\"Even with new developments, gas heating will continue to be the prefered choice, provided district heating does not limit it. But real estate developers' preferences are increasingly influenced by climate policy. However, since you cannot rely solely on solar or wind power in Estonia, we can see the future with combined solutions such as solar plus gas,\" Kotov said.\n",
      "Estonia's energy policy favors renewable fuels, which means that the use of natural gas for district heating has decreased year by year, while it is still needed to cover peak loads, especially during cold weather or winter, and as a reserve fuel.\n",
      "However, in industry, natural gas continues to be important, even indispensable, because it offers greater flexibility in managing industrial processes while being both environmentally sustainable and economically sound, Kotov noted.\n",
      "\"So we are moderately optimistic about the gas usage of industrial companies and we see growth opportunities. Instead, the amount of natural gas consumed in the future depends on how local industry as a whole is doing, whether it will survive in competition with other countries,\" he said.\n",
      "One area where the use of natural gas is on the rise is in the transport sector, which is increasingly becoming biomethane. Estonian biomethane is used in both public and freight transport.\n",
      "Kotov said three biomethane production complexes are expected to be added to Eesti Gaas this year and production will double compared to last year. However, this does not mean natural gas will quietly disappear from the market.\n",
      "\"Natural gas will not disappear from road transport, as biomethane production requires time-consuming investments, and natural gas is available at all times. Natural gas is like a bridge in the transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources and the natural gas infrastructure plays a very important role here, including in the development of hydrogen technology,\" Kotov said.\n",
      "According to Kotov, natural gas has great potential for growth in the shipping industry as there are an increasing number of LNG-powered vessels.\n",

      "Health Board: High risk of limited local coronavirus transmission ({{contentCtrl.commentsTotal}})\n",
      "The Health Board has updated its risk assessment for the spread of the coronavirus in Estonia and now believes the risk of limited local transmission to be high.\n",
      "The updated risk assessment comes after the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a coronavirus pandemic on Wednesday evening.\n",
      "In most cases, the disease has an incubation period of 5 to 6 days, but the virus is detectable in airway samples 1-2 days before and up to 37 days after the onset of symptoms.\n",
      "Mari-Anne Harma, head of the infectious disease monitoring and epidemic control department at the Estonian Health Board, said: \"It is important to remember that testing positive for the virus does not mean the person is necessarily infectious. The disease generally becomes infectious upon the emergence of symptoms; however, knowledge about this remains limited.\"\n",
      "Children and pregnant women are infected just like others, but children usually have mild symptoms and pregnant women have the same clinical signs as others.\n",
      "Currently, no serious complications have been observed in babies when the mother has had COVID-19 during her pregnancy. Similarly, the transmission of the disease to breast milk has not been observed.\n",
      "Older people and people with chronic illnesses, who are more likely to have severe forms of disease and higher mortality rates, are at risk.\n",
      "The main symptoms of coronavirus infection are fever, dry cough and fatigue, and in more severe cases, difficulty breathing. At present, approximately 80 percent of cases, including cases of pneumonia, have been mild to moderate. 14 percent of cases were serious cases and six percent were critically ill.\n",
      "Those returning from the risk area have to monitor their health for 14 days and stay at home\n",
      "People who have a reasonable suspicion of coronavirus infection should call their family doctor or family doctor's advice line at 1220. Emergency numbers 112 should be called in the event of a deterioration in health. You should not go to the emergency room.\n",
      "Coronavirus should be suspected if the person has been in the risk area for the last 14 days or has been in close contact with COVID-19 and has symptoms characteristic of the disease. Otherwise, it may be a flu or a flu-like virus that is widespread in Estonia.\n",
      "In addition to avoiding close contact with people who have symptoms of respiratory illness, adherence to hygiene rules, which include proper and constant washing of hands, helps prevent infectious diseases.\n",
      "Based on the recommendations of the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), as of March 11, the People's Republic of China, Italy, Iran and South Korea have been identified by the Health Authority as high-risk areas for coronavirus.\n",
      "Medium risk areas are Germany (North Rhine-Westphalia, Baden-Wuerttemberg and Bavaria), France (Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes, Bourgogne-Franche-Comté, Grand Est, Hauts-de-France, Ile-de-France), Tyrol ski resorts in Austria, Spain (Madrid, Catalonia and the Basque Country), Japan and Singapore.\n",
